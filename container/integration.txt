Integration Step-by-step

1. Install Docker
2. Download the T30 Docker directory with the Dockerfile
3. Open a Terminal to the directory and run command docker build - < Dockerfile
4. Run command docker images
5. The new image will have a name of <none> and be the latest image. Note the Image ID.
6. Run the command:

docker run -it --rm --privileged -e DISPLAY \
             -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
             -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
             <IMAGE ID GOES HERE>

7. The container runs as root. Git cloned files are in /root/.
8. You can test installing anything via apt, git cloning, etc. 
9. Make sure to do apt update before using.
10. Important: Any changes you make to the running container wonâ€™t be saved when it stops. You need to update the Docker file or use this procedure to save changes to an existing container.
